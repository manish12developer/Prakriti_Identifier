# Prakriti_Identifier
Prakriti Identifier is a React web app that helps users discover their Ayurvedic Prakriti type—Vata, Pitta, or Kapha—through a dynamic questionnaire. Each answer scores a dosha; results display the dominant type, dosha breakdown, and user’s responses. Clean, responsive UI with custom CSS.
