# 🌿 Prakriti Identifier

A modern React web application to help users discover their Ayurvedic Prakriti type—**Vata**, **Pitta**, or **Kapha**—by completing an interactive questionnaire.  
The app tallies the responses, analyzes the dominant dosha, and presents the user's Ayurvedic constitution along with a breakdown of their selections.  
The intuitive UI is designed for clarity, responsiveness, and a seamless user experience.
